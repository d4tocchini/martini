## Lean

It is built around a lot of core gems that make it so:

a. we don't have to rebuild the same thing over and over again
b. others, who feel the power, can focus on a specific set of functionality and build it into a gem, which we can use in Martini and others can use elsewhere

It is a very fully featured blogging system, but you don't have to be overwhelmed by the complexity.

Here's the gems it's based on...

## Developer Friendly

You can configure the site and write everything straight from your Text Editor of choice (TextMate!) if your developer, exactly like Jekyll.

## Syncable

Write your posts in Textile, on Google Docs, or with the Admin Panel!
